## Analyzing Inland Empire Patents with Python
*A study on visualizing patent localization through data manipulation.*

A Jupyter notebook built with three foundational goals in mind:

1. **Parse** a pre-existing dataset of patents in the United States, limiting our new dataset to patents filed in the Inland Empire.
2. **Create** a new clean dataset, discarding fields we don't need, and adding fields that we want.
3. **Visualize** our patent data onto a map using ArcGIS.
